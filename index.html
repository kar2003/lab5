            advance
            diploma in computer programming and analysis
            at Georgian college Barrie. I am from<em>KERALA</em>, a wondrful place to be raised in. It is a part of
            South India . Kerala is also known as <em>Gods On Country </em> as it has a lot of natural beauties like
            backwaters, beaches, mountains and rivers. In short it is a place full of greenary and serene.
        </p>
       

        <P> My family is still residing at<em> Kerala</em> . It consist of my father; who is a building construction worker,
            my
            mother; who is a government servent and i have an older sister who is doing her pg in data analytics.

        <p>
            I always wanted to go abroad and pursue my dream. And i always followed my dream. I was also sure about
            my
            destination. I believe <em> CANADA </em>
            can pave the way for me to a good future.
